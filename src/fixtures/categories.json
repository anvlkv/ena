All low voltage pumps and fans are connected directly to a solar panel, as they require to function (for cooling, ventilation, oxygenation, filtering, etc.)  when there is sun or heat, so precisely when there is solar power. This economises enormously on storage capacity and on energy needed for voltage conversion and transport. Essential appliances such as fridges and freezers are connected to our own 220v grid, with storage capacity of several days. There is also a backup from the grid and a possibility to produce back to the grid. This backdoor also reduces enormously the need for battery storage.<p/>",
